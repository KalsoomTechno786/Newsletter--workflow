📰 Multi-Agent Newsletter Workflow

A fully automated, multi-agent system designed to streamline the entire newsletter creation and distribution process—from researching news to regenerating to sending the final email.

This project demonstrates the power of multi-AI agents to handle complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention.

✨ Features
Automated Research: A dedicated Researcher Agent scours the web for relevant, up-to-date news on pre-defined topics.

Intelligent Rewriting: A Writer Agent takes the raw research, rephrases it for consistency, clarity, and tone, and ensures it's engaging for the target audience.

Newsletter Formatting: A Formatter Agent structures the rewritten content into a beautiful, professional, and email-ready newsletter layout (e.g., HTML or Markdown).

Email Distribution: A final Send email service to deliver the formatted newsletter to the subscription list.

Modular & Scalable: Built on a multi-agent framework (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, etc.), making it easy to add or modify agents and steps.
